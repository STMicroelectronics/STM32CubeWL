 * @brief Radio data transfer - read
 *
 * @remark This is a two-step radio read operation. It consists of writing the command, releasing then re-asserting the
 * NSS line, then reading a discarded dummy byte followed by data_length bytes of response data from the transceiver.
 * While reading the dummy bytes and the response data, the implementation of this function must ensure that only zero
 * bytes (NOP) are written to the SPI bus.

 * @param [in] command          Pointer to the buffer to be transmitted
 * @param [in] command_length   Buffer size to be transmitted
 * @param [out] data            Pointer to the buffer to be received
 * @param [in] data_length      Buffer size to be received
 *
 * @returns Operation status
 *
 * @remark Some hardware SPI implementations write arbitary values on the MOSI line while reading. If this is done on
 * the LR11XX, non-zero values may be interpreted as commands. This driver does not exploit this functionality, and
 * expects that zeros be sent on the MOSI line when this command is reading the command response data.

 *
 * @remark Formerly, that function depended on a lr11xx_hal_write_read API function, which required bidirectional SPI
 * communication. Given that all other radio functionality can be implemented with unidirectional SPI, it has been
 * decided to make this HAL API change to simplify implementation requirements.
